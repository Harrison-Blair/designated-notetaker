This project aims to fufill the need of a meeting transcriber and notetaker, designed to be run completely offline after installation and setup. The tool  hosts a variety of customization options, allowing you to take control of the format, model, and persistence of your recordings.

I have often found that when there needs to be a meeting notetaker, often the deicision is left up to pulling straws to see who takes on the task. In the event that nobody takes notes, often in later meetings details can be confused or lost alltogether.
